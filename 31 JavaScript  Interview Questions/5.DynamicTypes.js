/*
A variable can hold the value of any data type.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.

Since javascript is a loosely(dynamically) typed language, variables in JS are not associated with any type. A variable can hold the value of any data type.

For example, a variable which is assigned a number type can be converted to a string type:
*/

var n = 12;
var n ="Bhargov";
